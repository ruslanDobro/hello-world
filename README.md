# hello-world
This is how I learn to code, my small exercises and projects.
I am learning JavaScript and trying diffrent things to make sure that I can get from theory to real world applications. So far it is chalanging, I am still lookin for a good source of JS exercises examples to make sure I do not forget what I have learned.
